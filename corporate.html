                    <em>Rich Maroon: This deep, warm hue exudes a sense of sophistication and stability, 
                    instilling confidence and trust in the brand. The rich maroon also creates a feeling of warmth 
                    and comfort, reflecting the nostalgic and homely essence of Homecrate's service.</em>

                  #9F5B31
                    <em>Warm Brown: This earthy, inviting color evokes feelings of familiarity and reliability, 
                    resonating with the brand's commitment to connecting expats with their roots. The warm 
                    brown also embodies the natural and authentic elements of the carefully curated packages, 
                    highlighting Homecrate's dedication to delivering genuine, heartfelt experiences.</em>

                     <em>Soft Beige: This gentle, neutral tone complements the richer colors, adding a sense 
                     of balance and harmony to the overall palette. The soft beige represents the warmth,
                     comfort, and inclusivity that Homecrate aims to provide to expats from all backgrounds,
                     creating a welcoming and nurturing atmosphere.</em>

              </ul>

                <li>Font Choices: <br><br>
                     <em>Homecrate utilizes the Poppins font family, which is known for its friendly and 
                        approachable appearance. Poppins' rounded letterforms and open counters convey a 
                        sense of warmth and comfort, which aligns with Homecrate's brand identity as a company 
                        that provides expats with nostalgic items from their home countries. The various 
                        weights and styles of Poppins allow for flexibility in creating a visual hierarchy 
                        and emphasizing key information, making the content easily digestible and reinforcing 
                        the brand's commitment to clear communication.</em>
                </li><br>
                <li>User Interface Patterns: <br><br>
                    <ul>
                     <em><b>Navigation bar:</b> A horizontal navigation bar that provides users with easy 
                      access to different pages on the website. The navigation links include Home, Values, Visuals, 
                      Corporate, Product, and Contact.<br><br>

                     <b>Dropdown menu (phone only):</b> The navigation bar is responsive and collapses into a 
                     dropdown menu when the website is viewed on mobile devices. This is implemented using the 
                     Bootstrap "navbar-toggler" class and a button that toggles the menu's visibility.<br><br>

                     <b>Links:</b> The navigation links are used to navigate the website, directing users to the 
                     corresponding pages. These are created using the "nav-link" class.<br><br>

                     <b>Carousel:</b> A carousel is used to showcase a series of images in a slideshow format. 
                     The carousel is created using the "carousel" class and related attributes to control its 
                     behavior, such as autoplay, looping, and navigation controls.<br><br>

                     <b>iframe (video box):</b> An iframe is used to embed a YouTube video on the website. The 
                     video is set to autoplay, loop, and mute, with controls hidden. The iframe is wrapped in 
                     a "video-container" div, which also includes an overlay with the brand name.<br><br>

                     <b>Text box:</b> Text boxes are used for submitting an email adress when signing up for the Homecrate
                     newsletter, as well as sending us a custom message<br><br>

                     <b>Button:</b> Buttons are used for submitting a message for Homecrate, subscribing to the
                     newsletter, and visiting our Facebook and Instagram pages<br><br>

                     <b>Footer:</b> The footer contains copyright information, social media icons, and links to 
                     the brand's social media pages. It is styled using the "sticky-bottom" class to ensure it 
                     stays at the bottom of the page.<br><br>

                     <b>Grids:</b> The layout of the content is organized using Bootstrap's grid system, with 
                     "container-fluid," "row," and "col" classes to create a responsive and flexible layout.<br><br>
                        
                     <b>Divs:</b> The content is wrapped in div elements to group and style related elements. These 
                     divs are used in conjunction with the Bootstrap grid system to create a structured and organized layout.<br><br></em>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                 <li>Structure of the Navigation and Content: <br><br>
                     <em>The navigation is organized into a horizontal main menu, which provides easy browsing and 
                        access to content categories. While the desktop version does not have dropdown submenus, the 
                        mobile version features a submenu, ensuring a responsive and consistent user experience across 
                        different devices. The main content area uses flex containers, which enable organized content 
                        distribution and adaptability to various screen sizes. This organization allows for an intuitive 
                        and user-friendly browsing experience, tailored to the needs of Homecrate's expat customers who 
                        may be accessing the website from different devices and locations.</em>

          </ul>
          <h4 id="production-2.4" class="mt-2">Website Purpose</h4>
          <p>The purpose of this website - pre-launch website for our brand.</p>
          <ul>
            <p><em>
              There are a few reasons why it makes sense for Homecrate to have a pre-launch website:<br>

              Our pre-launch website is a great way for us to spark interest in Homecrate before the big day arrives. 
              By giving future customers a sneak peek at what we have to offer, we're igniting their curiosity and 
              creating a buzz around our brand, setting the stage for a successful launch.<br>

              Additionally, the website helps us understand our audience better. We can see what catches their attention, 
              gather their feedback, and use this valuable information to fine-tune our offerings and marketing strategies. 
              It's like having a conversation with our potential customers, making sure we're on the right track.<br>

              Lastly, the website is our playground for perfecting our message and brand positioning. By observing how visitors 
              interact with our content and listening to their input, we can craft a communication strategy that truly 
              resonates with our target audience, ensuring that our voice is both clear and compelling.
            </em></p>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 id="production-2.5" class="mt-2">Limitations</h4>
          <p>Technical and circumstancial limitations asociated with development of the website</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Video Player Loading - When the video in the iframe loads, it's possible to see the title of
              the video, as well as the navigation options. Unfortunately I found no way of hiding this, other than cropping
              the video, which presented a separate set of issues.
            </li>
            <li>Video Player not autoplaying on mobile - On mobile, the video in the iframe does not autoplay; this is
              because of limitations imposed by youtube, and since there is a div covering the video (to prevent interaction)
              it is not possible to play it at all. This could potentially be fixed by making a javascript which would click
              on the video, and afterwards make it non-interactible; however, this task was above my abilities.
            </li>
            <li>We could not find people availible for website testing specifically in our nieche (Expats) so we asked
              our classmates and frineds, a lot of whom, while not expacts by definition (because students do not officially
              count as expats), do come from different countries, making their experience similar in many ways.
            </li>
            <li>Our "Newsletter" and "Message us" options actually lead nowhere; this is because we are not actually gathering
              any data or emails. They are just a proof of concept.
            </li>
            <li>Also, the "Newsletter" and "Message us" options were very late additions, and therfore, were not part of the first
              couple of testing. Had we had them earlier, we would have included them; however, as it is, only the later interviews
              now have this question.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4 id="production-2" class="mt-2">Credits</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>HTML templates: None (this "corporate" page is the only template)</li>
            <li>The source code for UX patterns other than the ones provided by the “Bootstrap” library: None (all are bootstrap or original)</li>
            <li>Images that were not produced by students: 
                <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/icons/5296765/camera_instagram_instagram_logo_icon" target="_blank">Instagram Icon</a>

          <h4 id="production-3" class="mt-2">Testing Report</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Your testing goals: what you are trying to learn about your website?
              <ul>
                <li>Since our website is a pre-launch website, we are mainly trying to learn how well visitors 
                  can navigate the basic layout and find out information about the brand. The website is quite 
                  simple in its structure, only having the one navigation which leads to the different parts of 
                  the page. As a result, in our testing, we tested how effectively visitors can reach and find 
                  different information about our company.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your testing methods which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <b>participants</b>(number, match with target audience, etc.) - 6 participants, most 
                  of them foreigners, though none specifically labeled “Expats”, as they were all students, and 
                  expats must be full time workers. It included both men and women, from the ages of 19 - 24.
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <b>setting</b> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.) - 
                  The test was conducted with simple verbal instructions, a new one given every time a task has 
                  been completed. It was done on campus, with a variety of devices.
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <b>protocol</b> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.) - Instructions: 
                  [Find and read through our values - Then, go to the home page, and read about the founders of 
                  Homecrate - Then, find the font we use - Then, use our website to go directly to our Facebook 
                  profile - Lastly, sign up to our newsletter, or send us a message]. We recorded the screen and 
                  participants using a phone camera, always assigning a new task when the previous one was 
                  completed and intervening as little as possible.
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Your testing results, which includes information about:
              <ul>
                <li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Positives: Nobody was confused about navigating the actual site, the menu was clear, and visitors 
                    were able to identify the different buttons to move around. They were all able to find all the 
                    information in a relatively timely manner.</li>
                  <li>Negatives: Some people got confused when asked to find the information about the founders, 
                    for which they had to scroll down the home page. A lot of them went to the then present 
                    “contacts” tab. Some also clicked on elements which were not clickable.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website (or that would be implemented 
                  if doing so would be too complex) - “Contact” page was specified to “contact us”, and a space 
                  to leave a message and email was added. This was both to capture visitors and start building 
                  a base, but also to make it more clear what the point of the page is. Also, links to our 
                  Facebook and Instagram were added to the “Contact us” page; previously they were only in 
                  the footer, making them hard to find. Info from “Product” page was moved to home page, 
                  to reduce the number of clickable items. At the bottom of the home page, the option to 
                  subscribe to our newsletter was added, so that we can start to build a base of customers.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>1. Diminishing / lack of connection to home</li>
                <li>2. Unavailibility of specific local items</li>
                <li>3. Inability to travel home frequently / difficulty with transporting specific itmes (limited space, liquids, perishables etc)</li>

            </li><br>
            <li>Describe briefly how the problems are solved now (existing alternatives).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Telephonic contact, videochat, vacations home, reading local news</li>
                <li>2. Looking for alternatives, cooking/ making these items at home, bulk buying and taking on a palne</li>

          <ul>
            <li>Outline the brand solution you have for the above problem(s).</li><br>
                Our solution is a subscription crate (homecrate) comprised of items, foodstuffs and goodies from any expats given country
                of origin. Though we cannot replace the human connection, we can lessen the sense of diminishing connection by sparking
                feelings of nostalgia and joy, as well as physically reminding our customers of their home countries through their senses. 
                Flavours, smells, sights and touches can all evoke emotional responses, and the crates from Homecrate will all be filled
                with items specifically selected to envoke these responses, reegniting our custoemrs connection to their home.<br><br>

                They will no longer need to look for suplements or alternatives, or make them at home. They will also not need to pack
                an extra suitcase to make space for these items.</li>
