        <h2 id="production" class="mt-5">Production</h2>
        <h4 id="production-1" class="mt-2">Design Elements</h4>
        <p>Please provide a list of design elements alongside their justifications:</p>
        A colour scheme:

        <ul class="list-unstyled">
          <li>
            <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #541C1C;"></span>
            #541C1C
            <em>Rich Maroon: This deep, warm hue exudes a sense of sophistication and stability,
              instilling confidence and trust in the brand. The rich maroon also creates a feeling of warmth
              and comfort, reflecting the nostalgic and homely essence of Homecrate's service.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #9F5B31;"></span>
            #9F5B31
            <em>Warm Brown: This earthy, inviting color evokes feelings of familiarity and reliability,
              resonating with the brand's commitment to connecting expats with their roots. The warm
              brown also embodies the natural and authentic elements of the carefully curated packages,
              highlighting Homecrate's dedication to delivering genuine, heartfelt experiences.</em>
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="border border-secondary rounded px-2 me-1" style="background-color: #E6C7AF;"></span>
            #E6C7AF
            <em>Soft Beige: This gentle, neutral tone complements the richer colors, adding a sense
              of balance and harmony to the overall palette. The soft beige represents the warmth,
              comfort, and inclusivity that Homecrate aims to provide to expats from all backgrounds,
              creating a welcoming and nurturing atmosphere.</em>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Font Choices:</p>
        <em>Homecrate uses the Poppins font family, which is known for its friendly and
          approachable appearance. We chose it because of its simplicity and minimalist look paired with
          a very circular, soft shape. This combination works well for us, since we want to appear
          contemporary, but also very warm, homely and friendly.
          The various weights and styles of Poppins allow for flexibility in creating a visual hierarchy
          and emphasizing key information, making the content easily digestible and reinforcing
          the brand's commitment to clear communication.</em>
        <p>User Interface Patterns:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><em><strong>Sticky navigation bar:</strong> A horizontal navigation bar that provides users with easy
              access to different pages on the website. It sticks to the top of the screen, so users navigate the 
              website from any part of the page. The navigation links include Home, Values, Visuals,
              Corporate and Contact us</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Dropdown menu (phone only):</strong> The navigation bar is responsive and collapses into a
              dropdown menu when the website is viewed on mobile devices. This is implemented using the
              Bootstrap "navbar-toggler" class and a button that toggles the menu's visibility. This makes the nav bar not get in
              the way when viewed on a phone, and also allows the buttons that redirect to different pages to be bigger when the
              dropdown is engaged.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Links:</strong> The navigation links are used to navigate the website, directing users to
              the
              corresponding pages. These are created using the "nav-link" class.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Carousel:</strong> A carousel is used to showcase a series of images in a slideshow
              format.
              The carousel is created using the "carousel" class and related attributes to control its
              behavior, such as autoplay, looping, and navigation. Since the carousel is used to display our slogan, the
              navigation is disabled.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>iframe (video box):</strong> An iframe is used to embed a YouTube video on the website.
              The video is set to autoplay, loop, and mute. The iframe is wrapped in
              a "video-container" div, which also includes an overlay with the brand name. The video makes the website
              feel more lively, engaging and dynamic.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Email input field:</strong> The email input field is used to submit the users email when signing
              up for our newsletter, or sending us a message. It will not allow the user to submit anything that is not in the
              format of an email adress</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Textarea input field:</strong></em> The text input field is used to send us a message.</li>
          <li><em><strong>Button:</strong> Buttons are used for submitting a message for Homecrate, subscribing to
              the
              newsletter, and visiting our Facebook and Instagram pages.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Footer:</strong> The footer contains copyright information, social media icons, and links
              to
              the brand's social media pages. It is styled using the "sticky-bottom" class to ensure it
              stays at the bottom of the page.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Grids:</strong> The layout of the content is organized using Bootstrap's grid system, with
              "container-fluid," "row," and "col" classes to create a responsive and flexible layout.</em></li>
          <li><em><strong>Divs:</strong> The content is wrapped in div elements to group and style related elements.
              These
              divs are used in conjunction with the Bootstrap grid system to create a structured and organized
              layout.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Structure of the Navigation and Content:</p>
        <em>The navigation is organized into a horizontal main menu, which provides easy browsing and
          access to content categories. While the desktop version does not have dropdown submenus, the
          mobile version features a submenu, ensuring a responsive and consistent user experience across
          different devices. The main content area uses flex containers, which enable organized content
          distribution and adaptability to various screen sizes. This organization allows for an intuitive
          and user-friendly browsing experience, tailored to the needs of Homecrate's expat customers who
          may be accessing the website from different devices and locations.</em>

        <h4 id="production-2.4" class="mt-2">Website Purpose</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this website - pre-launch website for our brand.</p>
        <p>There are a few reasons why it makes sense for Homecrate to have a pre-launch website:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>
              Our pre-launch
              website is a great way for us to spark interest in Homecrate before the big day arrives.
              By giving future customers a sneak peek at what we have to offer, we're igniting their curiosity and
              creating a buzz around our brand, setting the stage for a successful launch.
            </em></li>
          <li><em>
              Additionally, the website helps us understand our audience better. We can see what catches their
              attention,
              gather their feedback, and use this valuable information to fine-tune our offerings and marketing
              strategies.
              It's like having a conversation with our potential customers, making sure we're on the right track.
            </em></li>

            </em></li>
          <li><em>
              Lastly, the website is our playground for perfecting our message and brand positioning. By observing
              how visitors
              interact with our content and listening to their input, we can craft a communication strategy that
              truly
              resonates with our target audience, ensuring that our voice is both clear and compelling.
            </em></li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="production-2.5" class="mt-2">Limitations</h4>
        <p>Technical and circumstancial limitations asociated with development of the website</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Video Player Loading - When the video in the iframe loads, it's possible to see the title of
            the video, as well as the navigation options. Unfortunately I found no way of hiding this, other than
            cropping
            the video, which presented a separate set of issues.
          </li>
          <li>Video Player not autoplaying on mobile - On mobile, the video in the iframe does not autoplay; this is
            because of limitations imposed by youtube, and since there is a div covering the video (to prevent
            interaction)
            it is not possible to play it at all. This could potentially be fixed by making a javascript which would
            click
            on the video, and afterwards make it non-interactible; however, this task was above my abilities.
          </li>
          <li>We could not find people availible for website testing specifically in our nieche (Expats) so we asked
            our classmates and frineds, a lot of whom, while not expacts by definition (because students do not
            officially
            count as expats), do come from different countries, making their experience similar in many ways.
          </li>
          <li>Our "Newsletter" and "Message us" options actually lead nowhere; this is because we are not actually
            gathering
            any data or emails. They are just a proof of concept.
          </li>
          <li>Also, the "Newsletter" and "Message us" options were very late additions, and therfore, were not part
            of the first
            couple of testing. Had we had them earlier, we would have included them; however, as it is, only the
            later interviews
            now have this question.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4 id="production-2" class="mt-2">Credits</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML templates: None (this "corporate" page is the only template)</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Your testing goals: what you are trying to learn about your website?
            <ul>
              <li>Since our website is a pre-launch website, we are mainly trying to learn how well visitors
                can navigate the basic layout and find out information about the brand. The website is quite
                simple in its structure, only having the one navigation which leads to the different parts of
                the page. As a result, in our testing, we tested how effectively visitors can reach and find
                different information about our company.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Your testing methods which includes information about:
            <ul>
              <li>The test&rsquo;s <b>participants</b>(number, match with target audience, etc.) - 6 participants,
                most
                of them foreigners, though none specifically labeled “Expats”, as they were all students, and
                expats must be full time workers. It included both men and women, from the ages of 19 - 24.
              <li>The test&rsquo;s <b>setting</b> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home,
                etc.) -
                The test was conducted with simple verbal instructions, a new one given every time a task has
                been completed. It was done on campus, with a variety of devices.
              <li>The test&rsquo;s <b>protocol</b> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.) -
                Instructions:
                [Find and read through our values - Then, go to the home page, and read about the founders of
                Homecrate - Then, find the font we use - Then, use our website to go directly to our Facebook
                profile - Lastly, sign up to our newsletter, or send us a message]. We recorded the screen and
                participants using a phone camera, always assigning a new task when the previous one was
                completed and intervening as little as possible.
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Your testing results, which includes information about:
            <ul>
              <li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance.</li>
              <li>Positives: #1 Nobody was confused about navigating the actual site, #2 the menu was clear, and
                visitors
                were able to identify the different buttons to move around. #3 They were all able to find all the
                information in a relatively timely manner.</li>
              <li>Negatives: #1 People were also trying
                to go back to the home page by clicking the homecrate logo, which only took them to the top of
                the current page. #2 Some people got confused when asked to find the information about the founders,
                for which they had to scroll down the home page, a lot of them went to the then present
                “contacts” tab. #3 Some also clicked on elements which were not clickable.</li>

              <li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website (or that would be implemented
                if doing so would be too complex) - “Contact” page was specified to “contact us”, and a space
                to leave a message and email was added. This was both to capture visitors and start building
                a base, but also to make it more clear what the point of the page is. Also, links to our
                Facebook and Instagram were added to the “Contact us” page; previously they were only in
                the footer, making them hard to find. Info from “Product” page was moved to home page,
                to reduce the number of clickable items. At the bottom of the home page, the option to
                subscribe to our newsletter was added, so that we can start to build a base of customers.
                we also made the homecrate logo in the top left corner take visitors back to the home page,
                instead of the top of the current page, becasue we observed that that was the way people tried to
                use it most of the time.</li>

        <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
        <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
        <p>Explain the context of the campaign is (What the campaign is about, what the message is, which
          promotional activities were executed). In addition, present the objectives as mentioned in the
          Communication & Media Plan. Explain and justify the chosen channels/platforms used and show there is a
          solid connection to
          the objectives established in the Communication & Media Plan.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>The Homecrate marketing campaign is designed to connect with the expat community by evoking
              feelings of
              nostalgia, promoting cultural pride, and fostering a sense of belonging among its audience. The
              campaign's
              primary message is to enable expats to cherish their cultural roots and create a strong bond with
              other
              expats
              who share similar experiences.</em></li>
          <li><em>The marketing campaign includes a six-week content calendar that features a variety of promotional
              activities
              such as sharing trivia about different home countries, landscapes or landmarks, recipes,
              cultural traditions, and interactive posts that encourage community growth and engagement.</em></li>
          <li><em>Our objectives were to Increase Instagram followers to 100 by the end of the six-week campaign,
              increase
              Facebook followers to 20 by the end of the six-week campaign, encourage audience engagement on both
              platforms,
              aiming for an average of 10 likes and 2 comments per post. Unfortunately, by the end of the six-week
              campaign,
              we only managed to gain 26 Instagram followers and 4 Facebook followers. Although we experienced some
              growth,
              it was quite a bit lower than our initial objectives.</em></li>
          <li><em>The chosen channels for this campaign are Instagram and Facebook, which are popular platforms for
              sharing
              visual content and enabling easy interaction among users. These platforms align
              well with the campaign's objectives, as they provide opportunities for expats to engage with the
              content,
              share their stories, and connect with one another.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
        <p>Identify and justify your learning point (based on the Communication & Media Plan). What did you learn
          during the duration of the project concerning the campaign? What worked and what didn't? What went as
          expected and what didn't? What would you do differently? Reflect on the past work and describe what you
          learned.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>The main thing we learned was that marketing on social media is about a lot more than just
              posting.
              While
              many of the posts weren't bad, the lack of interaction and communication outside of them meant that
              our
              social
              media did not grow nearly as fast as we had hoped. There seemed to be a lack of momentum in the
              campaign,
              and
              after an initial influx, the numbers stagnated. If we were to do it again, we would focus more on
              active
              interaction and engagement, and trying to create and upkeep momentum, rather than just post
              mindlessly.</em></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
        <p>Reflection on what has been done and describe in detail what you would do if the project would continue.
          Describe in detail your future recommendations if the campaign would be continued.
          Detail and describe clearly the process of what you would do differently based on your experience on
          this project related to the marketing assignment.</p>

        <p>
          If the project was to continue, we would for sure have to pivot in our approach. As mentioned above, our
          current approach is not getting us very far. Therefore, we would mainly change two things. First, we would
          be much more engaged with the community around our product, as now we were just kind of passively posting.
          We would be engaging with others, similar profiles, and building a loyal audience.<br><br>
          Second, we would start creating more engaging, spreadable content; reels, engaging in trends, spreading
          to TikTok. This would hopefully help us slowly gain a stable uptick of followers and engagement. Even as
          we introduce the actual product, our social media would remain focused mainly around the community,
          serving as a funnel to our service.

        </p>

        <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>

        <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are
          according
          to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly
          designed.</p>

        <p class="fw-bold">Problem</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List your top 3 problems you solve for your target group.
            <ul>
              <li>1. Diminishing / lack of connection to home</li>
              <li>2. Unavailability of specific local items</li>
              <li>3. Inability to travel home frequently / difficulty with transporting specific items (limited
                space, liquids, perishables etc)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Describe briefly how the problems are solved now (existing alternatives).
            <ul>
              <li>1. Telephonic contact, video chat, vacations home, reading local news</li>
              <li>2. Looking for alternatives, cooking/making these items at home, bulk buying and taking on a plane
              </li>
              <li>3. Focus on work, simply having to wait</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Solution</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Outline the brand solution you have for the above problem(s).</li>
          <li>
            Our solution is a subscription crate (homecrate) comprised of items, foodstuffs, and goodies from any
            expats given the country
            of origin. Though we cannot replace the human connection, we can lessen the sense of diminishing
            connection by sparking
            feelings of nostalgia and joy, as well as physically reminding our customers of their home countries
            through their senses.
            Flavors, smells, sights, and touches can all evoke emotional responses, and the crates from Homecrate will
            all be filled
            with items specifically selected to evoke these responses, reigniting our customers' connection to their
            home. They will no longer need to look for supplements or alternatives or make them at home. They will also
            not
            need to pack
            an extra suitcase to make space for these items.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Customer segments</p>
        <ul>
          <li>List your target customers and/or users.

              <li>Expats (and non-local students)</li>
              <li>20-40yo</li>
              <li>Working or studying</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Describe briefly the characteristics of your ideal customer (early adopter, brand persona).
            <ul>
              <li>Instagram/Facebook user</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Unique value proposition</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            When talking to expats, one problem that always comes up is homesickness. Yet there is
            no company trying to do anything about this. Homecrate Provides a unique
            service that delivers curated packages of items from expats' home countries straight to their
            doorstep. This way they can still have a piece of home with them, that they won't have to miss.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="fw-bold">Unfair advantage</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Deep understanding of expat emotions and needs, based on our founders' firsthand experiences</li>
          <li>Thoughtfully curated packages tailored to specific countries and cultures</li>

              <li>Assuming a monthly subscription price of 59€ per box, the gross profit

                To calculate the cost per unit, including fixed costs, let's assume that
                we have managed to acquire 700 subscribers per month. In this case, the total fixed
                costs per unit would be 11,800€ / 700 = 16.86€

                <strong>Total cost per unit (including fixed and variable costs):

            Homecrate offers a one-of-a-kind subscription service that delivers curated packages containing food,
            goodies, and nostalgic items from expats' home countries. By addressing the universal challenge of
            homesickness faced by expats, our service sets itself apart from other expat oriented products and
            caters specifically to a niche, yet sizable, market segment.
          </li>
          <li>
            Our unique value proposition is directly linked to the core of our brand identity - creating
            connections and evoking the warmth of home. Homecrate's service is designed to provide a tangible
            reminder of the customs, flavors, and memories that expats hold dear, reinforcing their cultural
            identity even while they reside in a foreign country.
          </li>
          <li>
            The brand image of Homecrate is built around the concepts of warmth, nostalgia, and personalization.
            Our service aligns seamlessly with this image by offering a tailored experience for every subscriber,
            ensuring that each package is filled with items that hold sentimental value and evoke memories. This
            strong alignment between our product, unique value proposition, brand identity, and brand image enables
            us to effectively communicate and deliver on our promise to bring a piece of home to expats, no matter
            where they may be in the world.

        <h4 id="management-2" class="mt-2">Validation of Assumptions</h4>
        <p>Write a reflection on the choices made in creating and choosing the trademark, including an analysis
          of the existing alternatives.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>When creating and developing the Homecrate trademark, our intention was to develop a brand that
              resonated personally with the expat community. We picked it because we saw and understood the
              unique emotional needs and challenges faced by those living away from their home countries.
              This played a significant role in shaping the brand's identity, image, and unique value proposition.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The existing alternatives for tackling homesickness among expats largely focused on communication
              with friends and family, or maybe trying to recreate a taste of home by making local dishes from
              scratch. However, these do not fully address the emotional and sensory connection to one's home
              country. With Homecrate, we saw an opportunity to fill this gap by providing a thoughtfully curated
              subscription service that delivered a piece of home directly to expats.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The trademark "Homecrate" was chosen to evoke a sense of warmth and nostalgia while also
              communicating the core offering of the service—a crate filled with items reminiscent of home.
              The name is easily relatable and memorable, creating an instant connection with the target audience.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>The brand's values, unique value proposition, and marketing materials all reflect a genuine
              understanding of the expat experience. They emphasize the importance of staying connected to
              one's roots and creating a sense of belonging through shared memories and emotions. The brand
              is built on a foundation of empathy, personal connection, and cultural understanding, which
              sets it apart from existing alternatives and creates a strong emotional bond with the target audience.</p>
